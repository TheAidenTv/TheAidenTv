## Student at University of New Brunswick Saint John | Computer Science Enthusiast

Hi there! I'm a student at the University of New Brunswick Saint John, where I'm pursuing my passion for computer science. With a strong interest in coding and building things that make everyday lives easier, I've been actively working on various projects and developing my skills to become a well-rounded software engineer.

Throughout my academic journey, I've honed my skills in programming languages such as Java and Python, and have worked on multiple android apps and games. I have a strong understanding of object-oriented programming and software development principles, and I'm always eager to learn and expand my knowledge.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading about the latest advancements in the tech industry, or playing video games. I'm a big fan of open-source software and enjoy contributing to the development community in any way that I can.

Thanks for stopping by!
